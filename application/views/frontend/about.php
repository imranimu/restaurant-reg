                      This is by far the best Indian and Classic Bangladeshi restaurant in Oxford and beyond! The Sunday
                      buffet lunch is great value for money and the service is excellent. There is a nice ambiance and
                      you eat at your leisure. You can help yourself to starters, main meals and desserts, Although
                      there are mostly chicken dishes for the mains for the Sunday buffet, there is a couple of
                      vegetarian dishes and starters and they do have a Complete Vegetarian menu only on Mondays! The
                      Food is excellent! I won't go anywhere else for a meal in Oxford.

                      We OFTEN eat here (can't stay away!) The new menu is terrific - some old favourites and some tasty
                      innovations. Really enjoyed Meat Free Monday tonight - subtle flavours & some South India
                      recipes.Staff unfailingly attentive, portions generous, prices absurdly low, considering we often
                      take home with us enough food for the next day, because we do get a bit carried away with such
                      wonderful choices. Very pleasant ambiance - good for a quiet meal & a chat, or for some
                      celebration.

                      Every time someone new comes into the indian restaurant scene in oxford, aziz steps up. Went last
                      night and was just brilliant. The atmosphere the staff and Aziz always makes time to speak to
                      every guest. Such a quality is lost in these newbies. I will always recommend this place. Congrats
                      on your 25th year. I hope we have you for another 25!!

                      A last minute booking for a large group of us (over 50 people). They were really accommodating and
                      offered us a varied menu with 3 main dishes, rice and papadoms. Excellent quality of food, good
                      cuts of meat and fresh vegetables. I would certainly go back.
